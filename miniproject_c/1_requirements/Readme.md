1. Introduction
The project is to build calculator software that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More sophisticated calculators can handle exponential operations, roots, logarithms, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions. Internally, some calculators actually perform all of these functions by repeated processes of addition.

2. Objectives & Requirements

2.1 Aging and costing 
At the time of starting of calculator these were made with solid state electronic devices.
As the time went electronic calculators came into existence and calculators with microprocessors
During those days the calculators costs hundreds of dollers per piece, As the technology goes on the cost of the calculators become low.

 2.2 4W1H
What?
A calculator is a device to use for the mathematical calculation, which makes work much easier.

When?
When the calculations to be made are complicated and take more time.

Where?
Where the calculations become complex to handle manually.

Why?
To make the complexity of the work less and to save time.

How?
Calculators are made depending on requirement. Different types of calculators are available such as simple calculator, scientific, graphical and printing calculators.


2.3 SWOT ANALYSIS

Strength 
•	Solve complicated problems
•	Consumes less time
•	Inexpensive to maintain  

weakness
•	For scientific calculators it is difficult read user manual.
•	Small mistakes give the whole answer wrong and needs recheck.
•	The size of number entered is limited.

Opportunity 
•	Calculators can be developed further scientifically with less complexities for user.

 Threats 
•	Each model of calculator need different instruction sets
•	Dependency on calculator  reduce human analyzation capacity.
